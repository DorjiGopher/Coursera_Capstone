Where is a recommended place to open a Mexico Food Restaurant in Los Angels city? 

Intro:
There are lots of Latino residents live in California, especially in Los Angels city. From an economics perspective, for both demand aspect and supply aspect, Los Angels will be a good market to open an idle Mexico restaurant with authentic Mexican foods. 
I would like to use data science and machine learning skill to explore this question and address it to people who are interested in it. 

Data Methodology:
Firstly, following the instruction, I will leverage the Foursquare location datal, mainly focusing on Venues data point. 

Secondly, I would generate Los Angles geojson data which includes neighborhoods names of Los Angles and their coordinate data point(Longitude, Latitude). Data is from University of Southern California database. 

Thildly, for data science method, I will use K-Means clustering method.
